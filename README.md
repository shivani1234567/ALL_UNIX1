Hello, System Programmers!
Welcome to the System Programming Repository! This repository contains examples demonstrating fundamental system programming concepts. It includes a simple demonstration of forking processes and inter-process communication (IPC) using named pipes (mkfifo).

These files are aimed at helping you understand key system programming concepts and how to use them effectively.

**Project Overview**
This repository demonstrates a few important system programming topics:

Forking processes using the fork() system call.
Reader and Writer programs using named pipes (mkfifo) for communication between processes.
These programs will help you get hands-on experience with:

Process creation using fork().
Basic inter-process communication using named pipes (mkfifo).
